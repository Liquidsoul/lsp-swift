# lsp-swift

Swift support for [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) using [@owensd's Swift Language Server](https://github.com/owensd/swift-langsrv).

Warning: this is currently very unstable and uses some relative path magic to launch the server. Using
this in production isn't recommended.
